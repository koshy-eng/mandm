üß© Project Title: Location-Based Family Challenge Game App
üì± App Overview
An interactive location-based mobile app that allows families or users to participate in real-world challenges and quizzes at specific venues (e.g., clubs, resorts, schools). Each challenge is associated with a location, timer, media, and a set of quizzes. The app uses a progression system where each challenge or quiz unlocks the next upon completion.

üåç Main Features
1. Challenge Management
Each Challenge includes:

id, name, lat, lng, radius

Media: image, charImage, guideImage, video

timer (duration in seconds), description, order

Progress Tracking:

isUnlocked, isCompleted, timeSpent, userPoints

Stored locally using sqflite in a table called challenges.

Progress saved when:

Challenge is started.

Timer runs.

User completes it (with points and duration).

Unlocked sequentially using local logic (order field).

2. Quiz Management
Each challenge has a list of Quiz questions:

id, question, answers (comma-separated), correctAnswer

points, challengeId

Progress Fields (local):

isCompleted, isUnlocked, userSelected

Quizzes are unlocked and answered sequentially (must answer one to unlock the next).

Data is pulled from an API like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
GET https://koshycoding.com/mandm/api/quizzes/{challengeId}
with Bearer token authorization.

Stored in local DB (quizzes table) with progress flags.

3. Timer Logic
Each challenge/quiz has a countdown (challengeTimer).

When time ends, the session ends (finishChallenge()).

Timer is paused on app background/exit (not fully implemented yet, but should be handled with WidgetsBindingObserver).

4. Local DB Schema (SQLite)
